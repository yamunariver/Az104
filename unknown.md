## Your company has a main office in Seattle and a branch office in New York.

You have an Azure subscription that contains an application named App1 and a user named User1 located in the Seattle office.

User1 travels to the New York office and receives the following error message when attempting to sign in to App1: “Your sign-in was blocked.”

When located in the Seattle office, the access of User1 functions properly, and no other users report issues with accessing App1.

You need to ensure that User1 can sign in to App1.

What should you do from the Microsoft Azure portal?


Select only one answer.

` `

`Add the New York office as a named location.`

`Configure Sign-in risk policy`

`Disable the Users at risk detected alerts setting for User1.`

`From the Risky sign-ins report, confirm that the sign-in of User1 is safe.`

`From the Risky users report, dismiss the user risk for User1.`

`Identity Protection provides organizations with three reports that they can use to investigate identity risks in their environment. These reports are Risky users, Risky sign-ins, and Risk detections. Investigation of events is key to better understanding and identifying any weak points in your security strategy. When users sign in to Azure from a remote location, Identity protection may identify these users as risky users. Unless the user risk is remediated, they will not be able to sign in. You can dismiss a user risk from the Risky users report in Identity Protection.`
